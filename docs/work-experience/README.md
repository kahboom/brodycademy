# Work Experience

On the left-hand side you'll see some links titled "Day 1", "Day 2", etc. There will be a page for each day you'll 
be doing work experience with the focus topic of the day.

Please keep in mind that these are merely suggestions, not required exercises.

:::info[Tip]
Don't worry if you either complete a day's work early, or don't finish it at all. These exercises are not properly time-scoped, they're just estimates and will be adjusted throughout the week.
