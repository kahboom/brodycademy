# Work Experience

On the left-hand side you'll see some links titled "Day 1", "Day 2", etc. There will be a page for each day you'll 
be doing work experience with the focus topic of the day.

Please keep in mind that these are merely suggestions, not required exercises.

:::info[Tip]
Don't worry if you either complete a day's work early, or don't finish it at all. These exercises are not properly time-scoped, they're just estimates and will be adjusted throughout the week.

Brody's objectives for this placement:

>Better knowledge of coding, experience in a working environment with a team, and better understanding of what a software engineer does


## Journaling

Your school suggests you keep a journal to track your work every day. This isn't required, so I'll leave it to you to decide whether to keep one.

Here are some suggestions for what you can write about:

- What did you do today? Trying explaining it to a child to test how well you understood the tasks
- What went well today? What things did you really enjoy? Was there anything in particular you didn't like doing?
- Did you get stuck on anything today?
- What would you like to learn more about?
