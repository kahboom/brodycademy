## Electronics 

These days, everyone spends a lot of their time on some form of a computer, be it their mobile phones or laptop. You might be inclined to think that we, as a whole, are more technologically inclined because we're surrounded by it. Overall, though, as our gadgets become more and more compact and user-friendly, we are becoming less familiar with how a computer, and even software, works.

Let's spend the day learning a bit about the computers around us. The perfect tool to do that with is a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learn). Think of it like a mini portable computer.

We'll be using an electronics kit that uses Python to teach you about how it works.
