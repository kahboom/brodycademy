## Presentation

Today you'll be doing a short presentation on things like how your week went, what you learned, what you'd like to continue to focus on into the future, etc.

Here is the template for your presentation, please let me know if you can't open and edit it or if it asks you to create an account: [Presentation Template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJ_oH3w00/Rr80rOGIFBoiXE5qHVlp-Q/edit?utm_content=DAGJ_oH3w00&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

Have you been keeping a journal? If you have, it could help to copy and paste some notes from there into your presentation, saving you time.

## Electronics 

These days, everyone spends a lot of their time on some form of a computer, be it their mobile phones or laptop. You might be inclined to think that we, as a whole, are more technologically inclined because we're surrounded by it. Overall, though, as our gadgets become more and more compact and user-friendly, we are becoming less familiar with how a computer, and even software, works.

Let's spend the day learning a bit about the computers around us. The perfect tool to do that with is a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learn). Think of it like a mini portable computer.

We'll be using an electronics kit that uses Python to teach you about how it works. It's called CamJam.

Here are the worksheets:

- [Worksheet 1: Introduction](CamJam-EduKit-1-Worksheet-1-(RPI.GPIO)-Introduction.pdf) - Not that I already did the steps of setting up git (remind me I probabl need to change the git config to be yours) and installing the operating system, so you can skip that part
- [Worksheet 2: LEDs](CamJam-EduKit-1-Worksheet-2-(RPI.GPIO)-LEDs.pdf)
- [Worksheet 3: Blinking LEDs](CamJam-EduKit-1-Worksheet-3-(RPI.GPIO)-Blinking-LEDs.pdf)
- [Worksheet 4: User Input](CamJam-EduKit-1-Worksheet-4-(RPI.GPIO)-User-Input.pdf)
- [Worksheet 5: Button](CamJam-EduKit-1-Worksheet-5-(RPI.GPIO)-Button.pdf)
- [Worksheet 6: Buzzer](CamJam-EduKit-1-Worksheet-6-(RPI.GPIO)-Buzzer.pdf)
- [Worksheet 7: Traffic Lights](CamJam-EduKit-1-Worksheet-7-(RPI.GPIO)-Traffic-Lights.pdf)
- [Worksheet 8: Games](CamJam-EduKit-1-Worksheet-8-(RPI.GPIO)-Games.pdf)

Let me know if you have any issues downloading or following them!

There is also a second kit for sensors we can do if you finish this one too quickly.
